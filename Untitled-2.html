                <p class="card-text">These often-used wise words became a reality when eight residents of Vishwaspur village in Raigarh district of Chhattisgarh, showed their will and determination to solve their water woes, problems regarding infrastructure and cleanliness. There are many instances where lack of adequate water led to crop failure and the hard work of the villagers went in vain. When Team Parshuram approached the village and heard the concerns of the villagers, they gave them a proposal on how to address their issues under Parshuram's ‘Dignity For Work’ (DFW) initiative. The residents of Vishwaspur decided to come together to work on these, and immediately after, they started digging the pond. The task became very strenuous as the stones in mud hindered theirwork, but they didn’t give up.........</p>

                <p class="card-text">“Earlier we were eating only onion & chili but now we eat green vegetables!.” shared Jamna Devi from Dahi Mata village in Udaipur. Vegetables have more or less disappeared from the diet of women in villages across India. Working with women on the issue of menstrual hygiene and management in Rajasthan, our teams set out to mobilize and encourage women to build their own kitchen gardens! Women invited to Parshuram's ‘Chuppi Todo Baithak’ awareness session on menstrual hygiene, taboos, discussed and shared about their challenges. With Seeds provided by Parshuram, many women immediately started building their gardens. On a visit to their villages sometime later we saw a green kitchen garden sprouting in almost every house. .....</p>

                <p class="card-text">Away from the frenzied global climate change discussions in the past few weeks children in a small village of Tamil Nadu decided to take the matter in their own hands. Parshuram team recently mobilized students of Alinjivakkam village in Thiruvallur district to take up an issue that bothers them and do something on it. Choosing Environment as their theme,theme, students of different age groups made skit shows, art, craft and other activities touching upon issues of deforestation and plastic hazards. They also created an exhibition around plastic ban and expressed the importance of plantation through songs and dance.  Under Parshuram's ‘School To School’ initiative every kid was rewarded with carefully designed Parshuram School .....</p>

                <p class="card-text">Parshuram’s work on neglected issues is often about sanitation as rural communities self-identify that as a priority issue.. People from Agunkumari, Jharbardoba, Jiabandhi, Pachadahara villages in Bankura (West Bengal) weren’t perturbed by the unpleasant job of cleaning their sewage drain. It took hard labour to remove plastic wraps and other filthy contaminations from their village drains. The clean drain has a direct link to stopping mosquito breeding and dirty water going to nearby ponds. The proud participants received carefully made Parshuram ‘Family kits’ under our #ClothForWork initiative.
